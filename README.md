# Graph-Theory-Project-Template
Project template of course - Graph Theory (EE6622E) in National Cheng Kung University.

## How to run

### Linux

```
# clone first (with submodule)
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/<your-name>/Graph-Theory-Project-Template.git
# (Option) build libfakemn.a
$ cd fake-mininet && make lib && cd .. && cp fake-mininet/libfakemn.a .
# build
$ make 
# run 
$ ./main.out
```

### Windows

If your PC is `window 10`, then you need to install the related dependencies. For example, if you are using `VSCode` as your IDE, then you can install the plugin of `C/C++` in your vscode. And then install the following programs/packages:
* mingw
* git

Step by step to create `c_cpp_properties.json` and `tasks.json`:
* `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `C/C++: Edit Configuration` -> then you have the first JSON file.
* `Ctrl+Shift+P` -> `Tasks: Configure Task` -> then you have the second JSON file.

Here is the setting of `c_cpp_properties.json` and `tasks.json`:
```json
# c_cpp_properties.json (If your mingw installed in another folder, then you have to change the value in `compilterPath`)
{
    "configurations": [
        {
            "name": "MinGW",
            "intelliSenseMode": "gcc-x64",
            "includePath": [
                "$(workspaceFolder)"
            ],
            "compilerPath": "C:/mingw/bin/gcc.exe",
            "cStandard": "c11",
            "cppStandard": "c++11"
        }
    ],
    "version": 4
}

# tasks.json
{
    "version": "2.0.0",
    "tasks": [
        {
            "label": "build",
            "type": "shell",
            "command": "g++",
            "args": [
                "-g",
                "main.cc",
                "-o",
                "main.exe",
                "-Ifake-mininet/lib",
                "-g3",
                "-L.",
                "-lfakemn_win",
                "-std=c++11"
            ],
            "group": {
                "kind": "build",
                "isDefault": true
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

After all the settings have been done, we can press `Ctrl+Shift+B` to run the task, if your settings is correct, then there will have an executable file which named `main.exe`.

## TODO - Your descriptions about solutions/algorithms/results
The solutions is based on 5 step:
1. Check strong connectivity
2. Find imbalanced nodes
3. Find additional paths
4. Insert additional paths
5. Specifying the Euler Tour

###Check strong connectivity

If a graph is not strong connectivity, there is a vertex that at least one other vertex can't reach it.
Therefor, the graph has no solution to the CCP.

###Find imbalanced nodes

Imbalanced nodes means that the degree of the node is not 0.
If a node with degree -1, it means the edges flowing in are one less than the edges flowing out.
Usually, the graph has some imbalanced nodes, otherwise the step can be skipped.
For example, we have two nodes a and b with degree 1, and two nodes c and d with degree -1.
The imbalanced nodes can be paired, a node with degree 1 pairs with a node with degree -1.
In the example, there are two possible combinations, which is :
1. a with c and b with d
2. a with d and b with c
The more imbalanced nodes in a graph, the more combinations are needs to find.
The practical method is to use permutation function by STL.
There are no needed to permutate both positive degree and negative degree nodes. One kind is enough.
